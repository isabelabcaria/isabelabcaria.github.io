                                Catalunya is a diverse territory, with extensive mountains, inland
                                depressions, and a coastline that stretches for 214 km. Its
                                provinces are very rich in natural scenery!

                                The most important and powerful initiative for promoting tourism in
                                the land is the Catalan Tourist Board (CTB), a team that conducts
                                promotional activities and commercial actions from both the
                                headquarters in Catalunya and tourist promotion offices distributed
                                around the world.

                                The project we worked on was the most important one in the last 5
                                years. It intends to change radiacally the offer and structure of
                                the tourism sector in the region as it aims to spread tourism beyond
                                the most popular spots, better distributing expenditure across all
                                provinces and reducing seasonality. </p>
                            <p>
                                The challenge was to contribute with a complete solution in which
                                the main objective was to bring tourists to regions that today do
                                not receive them, helping small business owners to enter the tourist
                                sector and to survive on what they offer in their region.

                                In normal situations the team would conduct field research, however,
                                considering the pandemic and its repercussions we had to replan all
                                the research process with tourists and tourism providers. Suddenly,
                                we (as the rest of the world) had to adapt, as humans, as a team and
                                as designers to embrace this new challenge of working and
                                interacting remotely!

                                We found out that travelers want to know the local, unique, real
                                experiences away from tourists, thus many travel in non touristic
                                periods. </p>

                                In light of this, the team ideated on how to create a way for
                                tourists to discover these unique experiences while helping tourism
                                providers manage their offers and balance demand in a way that it is
                                aligned with the CTB strategy. These needs made us think in terms of
                                ecosystems in order to truly generate value.

                                psychology. It involves moving from a conventional feedback loop to

                            Web app for tourists

                        <p>
                            The idea was based on the concept of yield management which is typically
                            used by airlines. Most of them sell seats for a variety of different
                            fares, the earlier the customer makes the reservation, lower fares might
                            be available, but if they decide to make a last minute booking, they
                            will probably pay the full fare. This way, fixed capacity of seats is
                            allocated in the most profitable manner possible. </p>
                        <p>
                            The concept developed derives from this idea by organizing tourist flow
                            across the regions and connecting tourism providers with this
                            information.

                                â€¢ We made the concept operational and designed the strategy through
                                the Blueprint and the Business Model Canvas. This grounded the ideas
                                to the client.
                                â€¢ We delivered a gamified experience to the client that went beyond
                                their expectations besides being a scalable solution.
                                â€¢ The Yield Management concept inspired in the CTB with future
                                directions for the tourism sector.
                                â€¢ We generated meaningful discussions around the changes in tourism
                                specially in a post pandemic world.
                                â€¢ The project is still being developed and might be implemented
                                within the next one or two years.
