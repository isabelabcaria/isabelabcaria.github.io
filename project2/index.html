                                In order to help them pursue this path, the challenge was to present two future scenarios (one more probable and one more disruptive) for their persona in 2030 regarding personal life and community, financial and family care, health and wellbeing, comsumption, mobility and travel, and work; find opportunity areas that connected with their strategy and develop a general strategic advice. </p>

                                A system map was built during the research phase to analyse the systems associated to the needs of the persona presented by the company and map the risks that could impact those needs aiming to find business opportunities.

                                We dig deep into 2030 trends around work and knowledge, automation, consumption, financial and family care, health and wellbeing, mobility and travel, future of insurance and how Generations Y and Z would relate to them.  On the interviews we focused on understanding current needs, behaviors, motivations and routines, as well as future thoughts of people in their 20s and 30s regarding the same topics.

                                Among other discoveries, we found out that both people in their 20s and in their 30s believe in an increasing prevalence of communal living in the future, that there's lack of knowledge about data usage and an unsafe feeling about it. Specially Generation Z see that insurance should help with global causes (social, environmental), for example, unemployment, people that do not have access to their services, people on the streets, nature. This finding guided our design process. </p>

                                Synthetizing and connecting trends and insights from the interviews allowed us to develop 2 future scenarios. In the possible scenario, Data Controls Your Life, life is completely remote and there is transparency of data. In the preposterous scenario,  Sustainability Über Alles,  sustainability plays a very strong role and there is no transparency of data.

                                Narratives were created for each scenario considering multiple spheres of this society that that this future persona would be living in 2030 encompassing economic, governmental, political, social and cultural aspects. This helped us ground the scenario in order to spot the opportunities and generate ideas that connected to the objectives of the company.

                                psychology. It involves moving from a conventional feedback loop to
                                a new habit-forming mechanism to hook users: the Hook Model. </p>

                                defenses and opening space for generating new habits. The idea is
                                based on the reward of the self, of the tribe and of the hunt. </p>
