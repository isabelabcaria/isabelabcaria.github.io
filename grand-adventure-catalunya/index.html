                                Tourism is a strategic sector and one of the economic driving forces
                                of the Catalan economy. How can tourists easily discover unique
                                places tourism providers attract more tourists and avoid
                                seasonality? Grand Adventure Catalunya is a scalable solution that

                                Catalunya is a diverse territory, with extensive mountains, inland
                                depressions, and a coastline that stretches for 214 km. Its
                                provinces are very rich in natural scenery!

                                The most important and powerful initiative for promoting tourism in
                                the land is the <b>Catalan Tourist Board (CTB)</b>, a team that conducts
                                promotional activities and commercial actions from both the
                                headquarters in Catalunya and tourist promotion offices distributed
                                around the world.

                                The project we worked on was the most important one in the last 5
                                years. It intends to change radiacally the offer and structure of
                                the tourism sector in the region as it aims to <b>spread tourism beyond
                                the most popular spots, better distributing expenditure across all
                                provinces and reducing seasonality.</b> </p>

                                The challenge was to contribute with a complete solution to <b>bring tourists to regions that today do
                                not receive them, helping small business owners to enter the tourist
                                sector and to survive on what they offer in their region.</b>

                                In normal situations the team would conduct field research, however,
                                considering the <b>pandemic</b> and its repercussions we had to replan all
                                the research process with tourists and tourism providers. Suddenly,
                                we (as the rest of the world) had to adapt, as humans, as a team and
                                as designers to embrace this new challenge of <b>working and

                            The idea was inspired by the concept of <b>yield management</b> mostly used by airlines. Typically the earlier the customer makes the reservation, lower fares might be available, but if they decide to make a last minute booking, they will probably pay the full fare.

                        <p>
                            Based on it, tourist flow is organized across the regions and tourism providers have access to the information.
