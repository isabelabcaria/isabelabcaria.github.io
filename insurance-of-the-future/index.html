                                When uncertainty strikes reality, radical shifts are caused in people’s needs, behaviours and expectations. It requires quick adaptation. How can the insurance industry become more customer centered and innovative in 2030? A communal insurance that goes beyond home and content, can help these organizations act more into prevention than intervention.

                                A system map was built during the research phase to analyse the systems associated to the needs of the persona presented by the company and map the risks that could impact those needs aiming to find business opportunities.

                                We dig deep into <b>2030 trends</b> around work and knowledge, automation, consumption, financial and family care, health and wellbeing, mobility and travel, future of insurance and how Generations Y and Z would relate to them.  On the interviews we focused on understanding current needs, behaviors, motivations and routines, as well as future thoughts of people in their 20s and 30s regarding the same topics.

                                Among other discoveries, we found out that <b>both people in their 20s and in their 30s believe in an increasing prevalence of communal living in the future, that there's lack of knowledge about data usage and an unsafe feeling about it. Specially Generation Z see that insurance should help with global causes (social, environmental)</b>, for example, unemployment, people that do not have access to their services, people on the streets, nature. These findings guided our design process. </p>

                                Synthetizing and connecting trends and insights from the interviews allowed us to develop 2 future scenarios. In the possible scenario, Data Controls Your Life, life is completely remote and there is transparency of data. In the preposterous scenario,  Sustainability Über Alles,  sustainability plays a very strong role and there is no transparency of data.

                                Narratives were created for each scenario considering multiple spheres of this society that that this future persona would be living in 2030 encompassing economic, governmental, political, social and cultural aspects. This helped us ground the scenario in order to spot the opportunities and generate ideas that connected to the objectives of the company.

                            Through this service, the insurance company enables, strengthens and facilitates the integration of the community members through the instructions/tasks given in the Shared Insurance Platform. Since the tasks can be shared between the people who live there, they are able to go through experiences to secure the community and reach their individual and common environmental goals (such as targets of carbon emissions or water footprint). By being inside the community helping people protect their homes, their love ones and accomplish environmental goals, the company itself gets greener and accomplishes its own duties with nature, thus preventing harm not only to the community but also to their very first common home: the planet.</p>
