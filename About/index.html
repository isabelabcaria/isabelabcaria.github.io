            <p>
                I navigate through Industrial Engineering and Service Design adapting lens according to the setting to design experiences with, for and to people. I tend to move quickly and naturally among different surroundings fostering exploration, collaboration, human centric perspective, critical point of view, team organization and broad view of processes. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I strongly believe life happens in the encounters! I practice the art of being present. I'm passionate about nature! Creative and adaptive environments enchant me. I flourish when I inspire movement in peopleâ€™s lives and love listening to their stories!
            </p>
            <p>
                I have this thing of seeing every experience as an opportunity to grow and evolve! I believe this takes us to the most unexpected and inspiring places.
